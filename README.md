# LiveLink

LiveLink is a site that automatically retrieves data on music events from external sources and allows users to search for events to go to using a more intuitive and feature-rich UI.

The site has been deployed here (http://livelink.site/feed) although the scheduled task to automatically populate the site with events has been temporarily disabled due to Facebook API's new policies (so it might look a bit empty at the moment!).

This site uses Umbraco CMS to store and manage the events. I have used Facebook API to look at the pages of relevant music venues and brands, and pull event data from these pages.
